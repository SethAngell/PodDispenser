# PodDispenser: A Super Simple Django Based Podcast Host
I don't feel like paying for an additional service and have compute + S3 storage to spare. So uh, lets build a podcasthost.

Big shoutout to the [rizmu/django-podcasting](https://github.com/rizumu/django-podcasting) for being the literal backbone of this project

You know the drill: Built using Django, styled with Tailwind, contained in docker, proxied by nginx, and chugging away happily on Linode.
